# SDC Hackathon Backend

This repository contains the backend API for a hackathon project, leveraging Google OAuth 2.0 authentication, Passport.js for user authentication management, and MongoDB for storing and managing user data using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Express.js:** Web framework for building robust Node.js applications.
    *   **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for simplified interaction with MongoDB.
    *   **Passport.js:** Middleware for handling user authentication strategies, including Google OAuth 2.0.
    *   **MongoDB:** NoSQL document database for flexible data storage and retrieval.
*   **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0: Provides secure user login using Google accounts.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Implements Google OAuth 2.0 authentication using Passport.js, allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts.
*   **User Data Management:** Facilitates CRUD operations for managing user data in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
*   **Scalable Data Storage:** Leverages MongoDB's document-oriented structure for flexible and scalable data handling.
*   **(Optional) Secure Communication:** Emphasize security measures if implemented, such as encryption for user data or HTTPS for secure communication.

## Installation and Usage

**(Please note:** This section will depend on your specific project setup. You'll need to fill in the details on how to install dependencies, configure your database, and run the development server.)

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manideepanasuri/SDC-Hackathon-Backend
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SDC-Hackathon-Backend
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Configure the application:

    *   Create a `.env` file (exclude from version control!) in the project root and provide necessary environment variables, such as:
        *   `MONGODB_URI`: Database connection details (MongoDB URI)
        *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth 2.0 client ID (obtain from Google Cloud Platform)
        *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth 2.0 client secret (obtain from Google Cloud Platform)
        *   (Potentially other environment variables your app requires)

5.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start  
    ```

## Additional Notes

*   This description can be further improved by adding code examples of API usage, especially for Google OAuth 2.0 integration.
*   Consider including instructions for setting up a development environment with Google Cloud Platform configuration and obtaining OAuth 2.0 credentials.
*   If your project is open-source, provide contribution guidelines.

## Security Considerations

*   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (database connection details, OAuth 2.0 credentials) in a `.env` file excluded from version control (add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file).
*   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for secure communication, especially in production.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user input to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
